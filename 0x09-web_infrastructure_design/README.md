# Web infrastructure design
## General
Draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops 
track projects explain what each component is doing explain system 
redundancy Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
### LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python)
Is an acronym denoting one of the most common solution stacks for many 
of the web's most popular applications. However, LAMP now refers to a 
generic software stack model and its components are largely 
interchangeable.
### Single point of failure (SPOF)
Is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system 
from working. SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high 
availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software 
application, or other industrial system.
### QPS
Queries per second (QPS) is a common measure of the amount of search 
traffic an information retrieval system, such as a search engine or a 
database, receives during one second. The term is used more broadly for 
any requestâ€“response system, more correctly called requests per second 
(RPS). High-traffic systems must watch their QPS in order to know when 
to scale the system to handle more load.
## File Descriptions
Each file contains a link to an image hosted on Imgur. These images are 
based on the following requirements:
### 0-simple_web_stack
On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the 
website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by 
having a user wanting to access your website. You must use: * 1 physical 
server * 1 web server (Nginx) * 1 application server * 1 application 
files (your code base) * 1 database (MySQL) * 1 domain name foobar.com 
configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
### 1-distributed_web_infrastructure
On a whiteboard, design a three servers web infrastructure that host the 
website www.foobar.com. You must use: * 2 physical servers * 1 web 
server (Nginx) * 1 application server * 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) * 1 
application files (your code base) * 1 database (MySQL)
### 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure
On a whiteboard, design a three servers web infrastructure that host the 
website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic and 
be monitored. You must use: * 3 firewalls * 1 SSL certificate to serve 
www.foobar.com over HTTPS * 3 monitoring clients (data collector for 
Sumologic or other monitoring services)
### 3-scale_up
You must add to 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure: * 1 physical 
server * 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other 
one * Split components (web server, application server, database) with 
their own server
